### Understanding penalties

```{r types_of_penalty_events}

types_of_penalty_events <- table(penalty_events$type)

```

We notice there are 4 types of penalty events:

* penalty lost
* penalty miss
* penalty saved
* penalty won


```{r game_ids_penalty_events}

# calculated so we can check manually what an event corresponds to
game_ids_penalty_events <- penalty_events %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(type) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(first(game_id))

```

Each penalty is recorded in 3 events of which two refer to the origin of the penalty and one to the outcome. 

Origin:
* penalty lost event (from the point of view of the defender)
* penalty won event (from the point of view of the attacker)

Outcome:
* penalty miss
* penalty saved
* goal
